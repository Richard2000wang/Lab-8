<h1> Richard Wang</h1>
<h2> Self introduction</h2>
<b> Hello, my name is Richard, and I'm <strong> very sorry</strong> for turning in the project late. Some things happened on friday and I lost track of time.
    I won't give any excuses, but feedback for this lab would be much appreciated. I enjoy reading and writing, and I am working my novel during my spare time.
    <em>However, there isn't a lot of spare time during this course.</em>
</b>

<b>Asides from this course, I am also in Set B, which means I am taking the same courses everyone else is taking. 
    The three of them are:
    <ol?>
        <li>Math 1310</li>
        <li>Business Communications 1116</li>
        <li><a herf = "https://learn.bcit.ca/d2l/le/content/714780/viewContent/5507869/View">Organizational Behaviour 1100</a> </li>
    </ol>
